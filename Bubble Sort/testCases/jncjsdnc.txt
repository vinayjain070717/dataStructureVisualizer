First of all,

Comparing the values at 
0 and 1.
The value at index 
0 is 20 and 
the value at index 
1 is 10. 
Since 
20 is greater than 10 
therefore swap the values at 
0 and 1

now,

Comparing the values of indices 0 and 1. the value at index 0 is 10 and the value at index 1 is 20. since 10 is not       greater than 20 therefore no swapping is required.

now,

Comparing the values of indices 0 and 1. the value at index 0 is 10 and the value at index 1 is 10. since 10 is not           greater than 10 therefore no swapping is required.
